Inside of your classes.txt file, pick at least one of the classes below
and define 5 attributes and 4 methods for that class. Make sure that your
methods either change an attribute, or utilize attributes for calculation
or display purposes.


Class: Plant

Attributes:
rootDepth (integer)
rootWidth (integer)
plantHeight (integer)
plantWidth (integer)
wateringFrequency (integer)
lastWatering (integer)
plantAlive (boolean)
plantCondition (string)


Methods:
calculateTimeUntilWatering (subtracts lastWatering from wateringFrequency)
calculateRootSize (multiplies rootDepth by rootWidth)
calculateBiomass (multiplies plantWidth by plantHeight)
waterNeeded (boolean check using plantAlive and calculateTimeUntilWatering)
